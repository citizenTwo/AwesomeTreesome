# Animated Data Structures
Animated Data Structures is a tool that demonstrates how data structures are created logically and physically. This programs prompts user to choose a data structure and the values that he/she desires to insert and then with the help of cool animations(and by cool, I mean like, really cool ;)), it displays how the data structure is created and how it's interpreted by the humans and by the system.

Our aims for making this tool was to help students understand the concept of data structures visually i.e graphical aid. It is well accepted that a person understands better when he/she can create an image of how it works and that is what our tools aim at providing, a visual representation of how the data is stored physically in the system and how the logic works.
